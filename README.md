Skin‑Lesion‑AI 🔬🖼️

Finetuning a Deep‑Learning Model for Early Skin‑Cancer Detection & Serving It with Gradio





Dermatologists agree: early detection of melanoma can raise the 5‑year survival rate above 99 %. Yet many people postpone seeing a specialist for a “weird‑looking” mole.
This repository delivers a plug‑and‑play deep‑learning pipeline that turns a single smartphone image into an instant benign vs. malignant risk score, helping triage suspicious lesions before they become life‑threatening.
